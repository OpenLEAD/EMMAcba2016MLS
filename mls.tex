\section{Moving Least Squares for surface interpolation}
Moving Least Squares (MLS), introduced by Backus-Gilbert, is a method for
near-best approximations to functionals on $\mathbb{R}^d$, using scattered-data
information. The method works very well for interpolation, smoothing and
derivatives' approximations, and the local error is bounded in terms of the
error of a local best polynomial approximation \cite{levin1998approximation}.

Let $M := {n+m \choose n}$ be the dimension of the space polynomials of degree
at most $m$ in $n$ variables, and $\Phi =
\{\phi_1(\textbf{x}),\phi_2(\textbf{x}),\cdots, \phi_M(\textbf{x})\}$ be the
monomials of degree at most $m$ in $n$ real variables \cite{bos1989moving}. For
instance, for $n=3$, $\Phi=\{x_1^i x_2^j x_3^k  | m \geq i+j+k\}$, and $i, j, k
\in \mathbb{N}_0$. 

Suppose that there are $N \geq M$ distinct points
$\textbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$, not all of which lie on the zero set of a
polynomial of degree at most $m$. The objective is to approximate
$f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, at $\textbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$, by
the weighted least-squares polynomial of degree $m$ at the points
$\textbf{x}_i$, $1\leq i \leq N$, with weights $w_i :=
w(\textbf{x}_i-\textbf{x}_0)$. It is an optimization problem described as:
\begin{equation}
\min_c (B^T\textbf{c}-\textbf{f})^TW(B^T\textbf{c}-\textbf{f})
\end{equation}
where $B^T \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$ is the Vandermonde matrix of the
monomials of degree at most $m$ evaluated at the points $x_i$:
$B_{ij}^T=\phi_j(\textbf{x}_i)$, $W=\textrm{diag}(w_1,w_2,\cdots,w_N) \in
\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$, $\textbf{f}=(f(\textbf{x}_1),\cdots,f(\textbf{x}_N))^T
\in \mathbb{R}^N$, and the approximation to $f(\textbf{x}_0)$ is
$\sum_{i=1}^{M}c_i\phi_i(\textbf{x}_0)$, $\textbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^M$. Under
assumptions of positive definite $W$ and full rank $B^T$, $\textbf{c}$ is the
solution of the normal equations:
\begin{equation}
(BWB^T)\textbf{c}=BW\textbf{f}
\end{equation}

In the specific case of surface interpolation, the objective is to
